### Hey, i'm Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

Currently working on my Bachelor of Information Systems degree at [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://usp.br)'s [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/), as a developer at [U-Get](https://br.linkedin.com/company/u-get), and on a couple personal projects.

I'm interested in FLOSS, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, and Functional Programming. Mainly working with Linux, Rust, Postgres, Nix, Python, and C/C++.

My repos are usually mirrored at [my own server](https://m7.rs/git). Check it out if you prefer to avoid github!
