### Hey, I'm Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in FLOSS, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, and Functional Programming. Mainly working with Linux, Rust, Postgres, Nix, Python, and C/C++.


I'm currently working torwards a MSc degree in Computer Science at [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://usp.br)'s [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/), as a DevOps Engineer at [Zoocha](https://zoocha.com), and on a couple personal projects.

My repos are usually mirrored at [my own server](https://m7.rs/git). Check it out if you prefer to avoid github!
